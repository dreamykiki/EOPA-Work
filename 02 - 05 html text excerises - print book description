    <h1>As I Lay Dying</h1>
    <h2>William Faulkner</h2>
    <p><u>As I Lay Dying</u> is <u>Faulkner</u>’s <b><i>harrowing</i></b> account of the <u>Bundren</u> family’s odyssey across the Mississippi countryside to bury <u>Addie</u>, their wife and mother. Narrated in turn by each of the family members—including <u>Addie</u> herself—as well as others, the novel ranges in mood, from <b><i>dark comedy</i></b> to the <b><i>deepest pathos</i></b>. Considered one of the most <b><i>influential</i></b> novels in American fiction in structure, style, and drama, <u>As I Lay Dying</u> is a true 20th-century <b><i>classic</i></b>.</p>
